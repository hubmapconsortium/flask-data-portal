description: 'The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations:
  one between the femur and tibia, and one between the femur and patella. It is the
  largest and most complicated joint in the human body. The knee is a mobile trocho-ginglymus
  (i.e. a pivotal hinge joint), which permits flexion and extension as well as a slight
  medial and lateral rotation[WP,unvetted].'
