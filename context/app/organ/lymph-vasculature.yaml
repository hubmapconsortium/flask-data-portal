description: A network of blunt ended vessels lacking direct connection to the blood
  vascular system. These vessels collect and drain fluids and macromolecules from
  interstitial spaces throughout the animal. They derive from a subpopulation of endothelial
  cells and have walls that are much thinner than the blood carrying vessels. Lymphatic
  vessels are usually classified as either superficial or deep.
