description: The brain is the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate, and
  most invertebrate, animals. Some primitive animals such as jellyfish and starfish
  have a decentralized nervous system without a brain, while sponges lack any nervous
  system at all. In vertebrates, the brain is located in the head, protected by the
  skull and close to the primary sensory apparatus of vision, hearing, balance, taste,
  and smell[WP].
