  details: "This reference consists of 64,693 kidney nuclei (10x Genomics snRNA-seq)\
    \ from\_healthy reference states generated by investigators in the Human Biomolecular\
    \ Atlas Program (HuBMAP) and the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The\
    \ dataset represents 21 samples across 13 patient donors. Samples were derived\
    \ from nephrectomy, biopsy, or deceased donor tissue, spanning three anatomical\
    \ regions: medulla, cortex and papilla. The annotations and the markers are provisional\
    \ (especially levels 2 and 3) and will likely get curated as more data are added\
    \ to the atlas.  More details regarding cell-type specific positive and negative\
    \ markers can be found in the supplementary tables 4, 5 and 8 [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454201).\n"
