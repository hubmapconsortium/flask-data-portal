# HuBMAP Assay Metadata Submission Format
## Draft Specification
*Chuck McCallum, Christine Briggs, Nils Gehlenborg*
## Overview
The approach described below is based on this simplified model of HuBMAP data entities  (the file icons are representing metadata files):

Metadata for HuBMAP assays are submitted as tabular text files with the following sections:

| Tissue References | Level 1 Attributes | Level 2 Attributes |	Level 3 Attributes | Level 4 Reference | Output Data Reference |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |

Sections general include multiple columns and are used to capture the metadata attributes associated with the assay (“Level 1”, “Level 2”, “Level 3”, “Level 4 ”, see below for definitions), to reference the input material for the assay (“Sample Reference”) as well as to reference the raw data files generated by the assay (“Output Data Reference”). 

In this context “reference” describes a column that contains a pointer to a HuBMAP ID, to a file (could also be a ZIP archive), or to a directory containing multiple files. The term “attribute” corresponds to a column in the tabular file.

A row in the metadata file can either refer to a single data file or to a directory of data files (which might contain further directories). In the latter case, the attributes provided in that row would apply to all files contained within the directory.
Metadata Levels for Assays
Definition of Levels
-	Level 1: These are attributes that are common to all assays, for example, the type (“CODEX”) and category of assay (“imaging”), a timestamp, and the name of the person who executed the assay.
-	Level 2: These are attributes that are common to a category of HuBMAP assays, i.e. imaging, sequencing, or mass spectrometry. For example, for imaging assays this includes fields such as x resolution and y resolution. 
-	Level 3: These are attributes that are specific to the type of assay, for example for CODEX that would include number of antibodies and number of cycles.
-	Level 4: This is information that might be unique to a lab or is not required for reproducibility or is otherwise not relevant for outside groups. This information is submitted in the form of a single file, a ZIP archive containing multiple files, or a directory of files. There is no formatting requirement (although formats readable with common tools such as text editors are preferable over proprietary binary formats).

Example for CODEX Data


Format Definition (here: “CODEX”)
Tissue Reference Section
This section links back to the tissue that the assay was executed on. The donor ID is redundant but can be used for sanity checks against the tissue ID.
donor_id
Description: HuBMAP ID of the donor of the assayed tissue.
Allowed Values: HuBMAP ID (must reference a donor)
tissue_id
Description: HuBMAP ID of the assayed tissue.
Allowed Values: HuBMAP ID (must reference a tissue)
Level 1 Attributes Section
execution_datetime
Description: Start date and time of assay.
Allowed Values: A date and time string formatted as “YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm ZZZ”, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month with leading 0s, and DD is the day with leading 0s, hh is the hour with leading zeros, mm are the minutes with leading zeros, and ZZZ is the three letter timezone abbreviation.
protocols_io_doi
Description: DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for this assay. Note: any parameters of this protocol should be captured as Level 3 fields. In exceptional cases, some parameters might be included in Level 4 information.
Allowed Values: DOI (e.g. "10.17504/protocols.io.basdiea6")
operator
Description: Name of the person responsible for executing the assay.
Allowed Values: Any string.
operator_email
Description: Email address for the operator.
Allowed Values: Syntactically correct email address.
pi
Description: Name of the principal investigator responsible for the data.
Allowed Values: Any string.
pi_email
Description: Email address for the principal investigator.
Allowed Values: Syntactically correct email address.
assay_category
Description: Each assay is placed into one of the following 3 general categories: generation of images of microscopic entities, identification & quantitation of molecules by mass spectrometry, and determination of nucleotide sequence.
Allowed Values: "microscopy", "mass-spectrometry", "sequencing"
assay_type
Description: The specific type of assay being executed.
Allowed Values: Will vary by assay_category:

mass_spectrometry:
LC-MS 
LC-MS/MS 
IMS positive
IMS negative
MS 
TMT
imaging:
AF
CODEX
Imaging Mass Cytometry
multiplexed IF
PAS microscopy
seqFISH
sequencing:
scRNA-Seq
bulk RNA
bulk ATAC
sci-ATAC-seq
sci-RNA-seq
SNARE-SEQ2
snATAC
snRNA
SPLiT-Seq
WGS
analyte_class
Description: Analytes are the target molecules being measured with the assay. Some assays target more than one analyte. For example, mass spectrometry assays such as MALDI IMS will detect peptides and lipids within the same experiment, as will DESI IMS.
Allowed values: A single analyte or a comma-delimited list of analytes. Categories of analytes :  “peptide”, "protein", "RNA", "DNA", "lipid", "metabolite" .
is_targeted
Description: Specifies whether or not a specific molecule(s) is/are targeted for detection/measurement by the assay. 
Allowed Values: "True" or "False".
Level 2 Attributes Section (here: “imaging”)
Different categories of assays (imaging, mass spectrometry, sequencing) will use different sets of Level 2 attributes. For this preview, we only cover those attributes shared by all imaging assays.
acquisition_instrument_vendor
Description: An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.
Allowed Values: Akoya, Zeiss,10xGenomics, ...   
acquisition_instrument_model
Description: Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.

Allowed Values: Any positive floating-point number.
resolution_z_unit
Description: The unit of incremental distance between image slices.
