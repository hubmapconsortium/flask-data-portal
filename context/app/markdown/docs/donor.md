# Donor Metadata

TODO: Donor Metadata documentation / specification to be provided by Jonathan Silverstein.

Test edit: This is where the TMC donor metadata acquisition and ingestion process is described as well as the format and content of metadata as abstracted by HIVE.
The metadata ingestion into Prov Graph is addressed elsewhere.
