# Description

The goal of the HuBMAP program is to develop an open framework and technologies for mapping the human body at cellular resolution as well as generating foundational maps for several tissues obtained from normal individuals across a wide range of ages. The experimental focus of HuBMAP is on generating molecular maps that are spatially resolved at the single-cell level using samples from a limited number of healthy people. More specific details can be found in our [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1629-x).

To fully integrate spatial and molecular data across individuals, HuBMAP will create a common coordinate framework (CCF) that defines a three-dimensional spatial representation. To achieve these objectives, HuBMAP envisions a strategy inspired by other tissue atlas efforts that leverages the identification of ‘landmark’ features, including key anatomical structures and canonical components of tissue organization (for example, epidermal boundaries and normally spatially invariant vasculature) that can be identified in all individuals.

To create these maps of the human body, researchers must first create a Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) that would allow scientists to precisely name and localize the samples and various individual cell types they had analyzed to spatially resolved positions within the human tissue, organs and the entire body. Creating a human body CCF on which others can continue to build is a foundational step needed for single-cell level maps of tissues and a unified map of the entire human body, and hence it is a major goal for HuBMAP.

As part of establishing a CCF, researchers must agree on a common set of information describing the relationships between the organs, organ substructures, tissue types, cells, cell types, and the biomarkers (specific signature) indicative of those cell types. Currently, the HuBMAP Mapping Team at Indiana University, led by Dr. Katy Börner, is establishing a data set (“tables”) that incorporate all the anatomical structures (AS), cell types (CT), and biomarkers (+B) from several human organs, a.k.a. the “ASCT+B tables”. These tables will enable researchers to locate, compare, and contrast the variety of cells, cell types, and biomarkers across the human body.  The ASCT+B tables can be visualized and sorted based on each label (node) or each relationship (connection between nodes) and can be read by machines.  You can see a slide presentation introducing the concept [HERE](https://cns.iu.edu/docs/presentations/20-Borner-HuBMAP-ISMB-CCF.pdf) and the progress of these tables [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_SLhFipRWUcRZrCDfNH15OWoiLf7cJks7NVppe3htI/edit#gid=1199090884) (see multiple organ specific tabs at the bottom) or a visualization [HERE](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter/).

HuBMAP needs diverse biomedical and technology experts to accomplish these goals, and welcome contributions from anyone who can assist in the effort to create ASCT+B tables for the human body! We are currently working with many members of the community, but we need more help and expertise from the community. If you are an expert on any specific organ’s structure and function, an ontologist, or a biologist studying tissue organization etc. and are interested in following the development of the project or in actively contributing please register [HERE](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bpaBhIr8XfdiNRH).
