  The brain is the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate, and most invertebrate, animals.
  Some primitive animals such as jellyfish and starfish have a decentralized nervous system
  without a brain, while sponges lack any nervous system at all. In vertebrates, the brain is
  located in the head, protected by the skull and close to the primary sensory apparatus of
  vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell[WP].
