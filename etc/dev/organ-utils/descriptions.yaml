# There is no API that links all the organ information across the different components,
# so we do it here, and then run make_organ_dir.py to generate the the per-organ yaml files
# that are used at render time by the organ pages.
#
# Links to datasets on the organ pages will not be generated until the datasets are public.
#
# Azimuth reference information is pulled from source files on github.
#
# Find organ descriptions at
# https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/search?ontology=uberon
# (These descriptions could plausibly be extracted by the script, but pasting them here gives us more control,
# and lets us add notes which may apply only for HuBMAP.)

      head, protected by the skull and close to the primary sensory apparatus of vision,
      hearing, balance, taste, and smell[WP].
