# portal-ui
HuBMAP Data Portal:
This is a Flask app, using React on the front end and primarily Elasticsearch on the back end,
wrapped in a Docker container for deployment using Docker Compose.
It is deployed at [portal.hubmapconsortium.org](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/)

The Data Portal depends, directly or indirectly, on many other HuBMAP repos:

## Feedback

Issues with the Portal can be reported [via email](mailto:help@hubmapconsortium.org).
More information on how issues are tracked across HuBMAP is available
[here](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/docs/feedback).

## Checkout

Because we're using git submodules, a couple additional steps are needed with checkout:
```
git clone https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/portal-ui.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
git config --global submodule.recurse true # Run this once...
git pull                                   # Now pulls submodules every time!
```

If you need to work on the code in a submodule, I would encourage you to do that
in a separate top-level checkout. You certainly can push changes from inside
a submodule, but it just gets more confusing.

## Development
Please install both eslint and prettier plugins for your IDE.

After checking out the project, cd-ing into it, and setting up a Python3.7 virtual environment,
- Get `app.conf` from another developer and place it at `context/instance/app.conf`.
- Run `./dev-start.sh` to start the webpack dev and flask servers and then visit [localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

The webpack dev server serves all files within the public directory and provides hot module replacement for the react application;
The webpack dev server proxies all requests outside of those for files in the public directory to the flask server.

### React File Structure
- Components with tests or styles should be placed in to their own directory.
- Styles should be placed in `style.*` where the extension is js for styled components or css for stylesheets.
- Tests should be placed in `*.spec.js` where the prefix is the name of the component.
- Each component directory should have an `index.js` which exports the component as default.
- Components which share a common domain can be placed in a directory within components named after the domain.

### Changelog files
Every PR should be reviewed, and every PR should include a new `CHANGELOG-something.md`:
These are concatenated by `push.sh`.

## Testing
[`test.sh`](test.sh) wraps all the tests and is run on Travis.
Python unit tests use Pytest, front end tests use Jest, an end-to-end tests use Cypress.
Look at the source code of the script to see how to run a particular set of tests.

Load tests [are available](end-to-end/artillery/), but they are not part of `test.sh`.

### Linting and pre-commit hooks
In addition, `test.sh` lints the codebase, and to save time, we also lint in a pre-commit hook.
If you want to bypass the hook, set `HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS=1`.

You can also lint and auto-correct from the command-line:
```
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

## Build, tag, and deploy
We plan to release new images Mondays and Wednesdays, and these are deployed to production the following day. [More details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vto1RYRCG6w3z9PtgEFCWv2GCSLPgBT3p_7n-5udpgo/edit#heading=h.4ddr60vky5f).

To build a new image for [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hubmap/portal-ui),
and tag a release on github, just run:
```
./push.sh
```

Then, to redeploy `dev`, `test`, and `stage`:
```
# PSC will need a ssh public key for USERNAME.
./redeploy.sh $USERNAME dev
./redeploy.sh $USERNAME test
./redeploy.sh $USERNAME stage
```

IEC is responsible for deploying to production.

### Maintenace page

If the maintence page ever needs to be updated, you'll need to build the bundle,
and then make a PR against the `gateway` repo:

<details>

```
cd context/
npm run build:maintain
cd ${YOUR_HUBMAP_REPOS}/gateway
git checkout master; git pull
git checkout -b update-portal-ui-maintenance
cp ${YOUR_HUBMAP_REPOS}/portal-ui/context/app/static/js/maintenance/public/* \
   nginx/html/portal-ui-maintenance/
git add .; git commit -m 'Update portal-ui maintenance'
git push --set-upstream origin update-portal-ui-maintenance
```

</details>

### Understanding the build

To view visualizations of the production webpack bundle run `npm run build:analyze`.
The script will generate two files, report.html and stats.html, inside the public directory each showing a different visual representation of the bundle.

To build and run the docker image locally:
```sh
./docker.sh 5001 --follow
```
Our base image is based on [this template](https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker#quick-start-for-bigger-projects-structured-as-a-python-package).

In the deployments, our container is behind a NGINX reverse reproxy;
Here's a [simple demonstration](compose/) of how that works.
