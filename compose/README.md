# Docker Compose

This directory is used for deploying the portal-ui with docker-compose. The `dev.yml` can be used to spin up the container quickly by pulling the image from DockerHub, and the `test.yml` is used for deploying this portal-ui on the testing server.

We first need to [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Local dev

You'll need a configuration file in place at `context/instance/app.conf`:
Globus access requires a secret key, so this is not checked in:
Instead ask another developer to share theirs.

To start up the container with Docker Compose, `cd compose` and then:

````
docker-compose -f base.yml -f dev.yml up
````

You will see the logs of the containers in stdout. Once it's ready, you'll be able to access the portal at  http://localhost:5000/. If you want to run the container in background:

````
docker-compose -f base.yml -f dev.yml up -d
````

To safely stop the active container:

````
docker-compose -f base.yml -f dev.yml stop
````

## Deployment on HuBMAP testing server

For testing deployment, the [HuBMAP Gateway](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/gateway.git) handles the SSL certificates and domain name. All the requests to `https://portal.test.hubmapconsortium.org/` will be send to the Gateway's nginx, then proxied to the `portal-ui` container where another nginx listens on port 80.

Uncomment one of the `SERVER_NAME` lines in app.conf: With an explicit `SERVER_NAME`,
it will not work on localhost, but it is required for deployments.

Starting and stopping the container in the testing environment is similar to the local dev, just replace `dev.yml` with `test.yml`.
