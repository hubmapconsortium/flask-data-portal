- Support free-text search, using the "everything" field we create at index time.
- Make the header icon stats into.
- Add histogram selectors for Age and BMI.
- No login required for CCF.
- Fix pagination by updating searchkit.
- Get rid of search-schema submodule: We are giving up on validation, and the mappings are handled at index-time.
- Get rid of excess space at top of search page.
- Show ancestor constraint.
- Point to the `portal` index.
- Fixed a bug on expansion of Vitessce due to `z-index` not being taken into account without `position: relative` as well.

- Add the CCF page to python tests.
- Fix bug in our template for the CCF.
- Fix errors displaying Visualization in table of contents.
- Enable free-text search. Caveats: 
  - Values represented with abbreviations will not be searchable until we have our own index up which expands them.
  - Only searching the column fields right now. Searching all fields could be done by:
    - Listing every single field in the config here.
    - Using ES mapping to copy fields during indexing. (https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/search-api/issues/63)
    - Doing it explicitly in the code which constructs our index.
- Provide hubmapPortalUrl to CCF.
- Make VERSION a MD file: Easy to remember path, ("/VERSION") and it doesn't try to download the file. Downside: No URL to curl that just returns the VERSION without anything else... but we could add a raw MD handler, if needed.
- Get doctests working in Python.
